# Project Management

This is a simple project about projects assigned to students.
Two GUI's are provided in the same application: the first one sports a bad design, in which each entity has a CRUD, and you need to take down data in order to edit other entities.

The second one sports a good design in the sense that supports full integration: you can easily know which entity to modify, even when it is included in another one.

## Build and run

Just trigger the `dotnet` tool for building, or for running the app. This app uses Avalonia, which must be downloaded and compiled the first time.

```
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet run
```
